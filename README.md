# SARS-CoV-2_tools

This repository stores in house scripts used to automatize some routine tasks with SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Almos all scripts here part of the principle that the genomes used as input have the same pattern of names that are present on [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/). CSV files were updated on 23 December 2020.

## Dependencies

The scripts were built on python 3.6.5+ and have these dependencies:

- [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html);
- [biopython](https://biopython.org/);
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

## Recomended lectures
- [Pangolin ](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin): To understand the lineages pattern.
- [Issues with hCoV-19 sequencing data ](https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473): To understand the sites present on algn_mask.py
- [GISAID information ](https://www.gisaid.org/): To access the most update hCoV-19 genomic information.

## Disclaimer
- If you use one of these scripts, please reference this repository;
- Fell free to commit changes that make the code more efficient or cleaner.
- This script will continue to be developed to englobe other functions.
